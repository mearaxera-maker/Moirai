Investor & partner pitch (one-pager)

The reimagined dream
Start with the thing everyone understands: the phone that feels slow when you type, the brush that lags under your cursor. Now scale that sensation up and out — to latency-critical servers, real-time edge appliances, and workstations where microsecond delays compound into user frustration and energy waste. GMU is the micro-architectural intervention that dissolves repetitive friction across the stack: tiny, auditable, and built to be embedded.

Why investors should care
- Fast, low-cost path to an impactful demo: a small FPGA or chiplet prototype can prove the core hypothesis and win partner engineering attention.
- Massive addressable surface: any SoC maker or hyperscaler that cares about latency, energy, and on-device privacy is a potential partner or licensee.
- Multiple monetization vectors: IP licensing to SoC vendors, per-device certification, tooling/analytics services, and a paid developer certification program.
- Risk profile: limited silicon scope and conservative generator expressiveness make verification and security tractable relative to every other on-die AI experiment.

Strategic positioning
GMU is a force multiplier for CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. It quietly extracts value from the repetitive micro-workload tax that otherwise dilutes core performance. Rather than displacing existing accelerators, GMU increases their effective throughput and reduces the marginal energy cost of the workloads they run. The right partners will see GMU as a non-disruptive, high-ROI adjunct to their existing roadmap.

Tangible metrics we aim to sell
- Target: 30–70% energy reduction on selected microbenchmarks; 2–10x latency improvement on hot paths.
- Business case: For an OEM, the perceived performance uplift and battery wins translate directly into higher product differentiation and reduced cloud-expenditure for privacy-sensitive features.

Go-to-market & partnership
- Short path: build a convincing demo (typing/brush auto-fill + small-array transforms) and engage an SoC partner for integration trials.
- Long path: license IP and provide certification & tools to enable large-scale adoption across OEMs and hyperscalers.

Team asks (immediate)
- Hardware architects and RTL engineers to complete a prototype.
- Compiler/runtime engineers to design pragmatic hooks and a minimal SDK.
- Security & verification engineers to finalize attestation flows and golden-model checks.
- Intros to SoC integration teams (Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung LSI) and product leaders at OEMs.

Valuation & lead interest (founder-provided)
The founder believes that a validated prototype plus a first strategic license can support an early-stage valuation in the hundreds of millions. There is an early client lead who has expressed a willingness to back a substantial commercial relationship and who views an SoC-level partnership (Qualcomm or similar) as the most direct path to scale. That prospective backing informs our commercial strategy but is not an executed agreement; it is included for context in partner conversations.

Closing
GMU is a small architectural wedge with outsized leverage: narrow in scope, high in ROI. We are building an open technical blueprint to accelerate adoption and attract the engineering and strategic partners that can convert a great idea into a platform-level change. If you want to help build the micro-architectural component that makes big compute feel instant — and help shape how the next generation of SoCs trade latency for energy — we should talk.
