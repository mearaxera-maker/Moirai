# Generative Memory Unit (GMU)

Tagline
A compact, on-chip generative layer that learns tiny, repeatable memory patterns and synthesizes them near the CPU to cut latency, reduce energy, and reframe how software thinks about data locality.

The dream (expanded)
Imagine every point of computational friction dissolved. Consider mobile interfaces that feel an order of magnitude more instantaneous, latency on mission-critical server applications reduced to a whisper, and the energy draw on high-demand desktops noticeably curtailed. This is a technology that thrives on repetition — a tiny, auditable hardware block that learns to synthesize the values a system asks for most, turning inefficiency into pure efficiency and converting recurring waste into competitive advantage.

Why this matters (the problem)
- Modern processors are bottlenecked by data movement more than by raw compute.
- Many real-world workloads (interactive UI, small-array math, codecs, incremental transforms, and tight control-flow loops) are dominated by small, highly-repetitive memory patterns that conventional caches treat inefficiently.
- Generating correct, register-ready values for these hot, repeatable accesses near the core removes fetch cost, lowers latency, and saves power — all without moving more data up and down the memory hierarchy.

The product (one line)
A tiny, secure, low-power hardware+software layer (chiplet or on-die block) that smells patterns, stores compact formulas, and generates register-ready values before the CPU asks for them.

Why now (market & traction)
- SoC vendors and mobile partners are investing aggressively in on-device generative AI and specialized accelerators.
- A modest, workplace-sized design targeting the most frequent high-latency memory traffic can be prototyped as a chiplet or NPU sub-block — low upfront cost, high licensing upside.
- Founder note: an early strategic lead believes a validated prototype plus a partner license could justify a valuation in the hundreds of millions; Qualcomm is an expected strategic partner for scale.

Value proposition (what customers get)
- Dramatically snappier perceived performance on interactive workloads (typing, drawing, UI composition).
- Lower energy per operation for repetitive workloads — tangible battery life improvements.
- Fewer cloud trips for small, sensitive data: better privacy and lower network cost.
- Offloads micro-work from CPU/GPU/NPU, enabling cores to focus on macro-scale tasks.

Core components (high level)
- Patterning Engine (hierarchical): bit-level, byte-level, and stream-level detectors.
- Formula Cache: tiny, ultra-low-latency store of meta-patterns & compact generators.
- Generative Core: constrained, auditable generator that synthesizes values on demand.
- GMU Runtime & Compiler Hooks: OS/SDK layer and compiler annotations to guide usage.
- Security Fabric: on-chip root-of-trust, signed formulas, attestation, immutable firmware.

Competitive landscape — what we are
GMU is not a challenger to general-purpose CPUs, GPUs, or NPUs; it is their silent enabler. We are the precision tool that removes incessant, repetitive micro-work so the big processors can do what they do best. By offloading the tiny, deterministic tasks that consume disproportionate cycles and energy, GMU elevates the throughput, efficiency, and value of existing compute fabric. We do not compete for control — we multiply the value of the platforms we integrate with.

MVP goals (first 12 weeks)
1. Literature & patent brief + prioritized use cases.
2. Cycle-approximate simulator or RTL skeleton modeling a Formula Cache and toy generative core.
3. API/pragma prototype and a minimal host runtime demonstrating gains on a note-taking/typing demo (simulated).
4. Minimal security model: signed-formula format and attestation flow documented.

How this repo is structured
- /docs — proposals, architecture diagrams, spec drafts
- /research — annotated bibliography, patents, related work
- /proto — simulation skeletons, minimal Verilog prototypes, microbenchmarks
- /api — candidate API/pragma descriptions, syscall proposals, example apps
- /design — block diagrams, power/area/latency targets and trade studies
- /governance — license, contributing, code of conduct

What we need (roles)
- Hardware architects (RTL, micro-arch, chiplet integration)
- Compiler/runtime engineers (pragmas, toolchain hooks, kernel integration)
- Security engineers (TEE/attestation, immutable firmware design)
- Researchers (benchmarks, formal verification, pattern taxonomy)
- Product/BD (partner introductions, SoC engagement, go-to-market)

Quick start (for new contributors)
1. Read /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and /docs/SPECS.md.
2. Pick a "good first issue" under Issues (labels exist).
3. Fork → branch → PR. We’ll help onboard and review.

License & governance
- Suggested: CERN OHL-S v2 for hardware artifacts; Apache-2.0 for software prototypes. See /governance/LICENSE.md for recommended wording.

Investor & partner note
This is a high-leverage, low-cap-ex-first-stage innovation: a crisp demo and a defensible IP posture can unlock large licensing deals. The founder has signaled an early lead client and an ambition toward a valuation in the hundreds of millions if design de-risking and a partner license can be secured quickly. That is a credible path, not a promise — early technical validation and targeted partner outreach are required.

Roadmap (short)
- Week 0–2: repo & community setup, research collection, block diagrams
- Week 2–6: simulation skeleton, API draft, sample workloads
- Week 6–12: RTL prototype + FPGA proof-of-concept, security spec, tech demo
