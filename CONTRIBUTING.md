## Contributing to GMU

Community values
- Be collaborative and evidence-focused.
- Prioritize reproducible engineering artifacts (diagrams, sims, bench scripts).
- Respect privacy and security work â€” do responsible disclosure.

Getting started
1. Read docs/SPECS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
2. Check issues and claim one by commenting.
3. Fork, branch (feat/<short-name>) and open a PR.

Roles & sponsorships
- Hardware: work on proto/RTL and area/power trade studies.
- Compiler/Runtime: propose and prototype pragmas and syscalls in /api.
- Security: design attestation and signed-formula protocols.
- Research: collect references and write annotated analysis in /research.

Perks & incentives
- Early contributors will be public co-authors on foundational papers and contributors to a canonical GMU reference.
- The project maintains an "early contributor" recognition that will be visible in governance docs and potential commercial licensing discussions.

How we help
- We will mentor early contributors on repo conventions and how to run the small simulator.
- We will triage issues weekly and help unblock PRs.
